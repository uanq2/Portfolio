            <p>By obtaining a Bachelorâ€™s in Graphic Design and a Certificate in Full Stack Web Development, I am able to bring innovative ideas and solutions to design outstanding web sites and computer programs to companies in the technology industry. I possess HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Adobe Design Software knowledge that allowed me to successfully develop a music playlist generator for a project in a team of four and my own portfolio page. I demonstrated quick learning, high attention to detail, teamwork and problem solving skills to execute both of these projects. I am confident and motivated that I can apply all my technical and personal skills in any role as a Graphic Designer and Web Developer to keep growing as a person as well as helping any employer grow.</p>
